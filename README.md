# Android Design Framework

This is a blank android project with some classes/interfaces/folders to assist with large Android Projects

## Getting Started

Copy this code into and new, empty android project. The root of this directory 'app' will get placed in your newly created android folder in place of the existing 'app' folder.

### Prerequisites

I used Android Studio to create a blank android project.

```
Give examples

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
