# Android Design Framework

This is a blank android project with some classes/interfaces/folders to assist with large Android Projects

## Getting Started

Copy this code into and new, empty android project. The root of this directory 'app' will get placed in your newly created android folder in place of the existing 'app' folder.

### Prerequisites

I used Android Studio to create a blank android project.

### Installing

After you have created a blank project, just replace the autogenerated 'app' folder with the one in this repository.
